# Predicting-Annual-Medical-Insurance-Costs

This project aims to utilize characteristic lifestyle data such as BMI and smoking history to predict an individual’s health insurance cost using machine learning models. This will provide insight into which attributes have the strongest effect on healthcare expenses, help improve cost forecasting for insurance providers, and highlight how lifestyle choices impact medical costs.
